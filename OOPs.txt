Inheritance:
One class inherite properties from another class is known as Inheritance OR IS-A Relationship.
Using extends keyword we can inheritanc properties of one class into another.
Note: One Interface can extend properties of another interface.

One class can extend exactly one and only one parent class
(multiple inheritance is not possible for class)

class A  extends B{

}


One Interface can extend multiple interfaces 
(multiple inheritance is possible for interfaces.)

interface I1  extends I2,I3 {

}

For classes and interfaces multi-level inheritance is possible.

Polymorphism:

Poly- Many
Morphism - Forms

Example: One person play  different role like Employee,Son,Customer,Friend is nothing but polymorphism

2 types of Polymorphism:
===========================
1. Static/Compile time polymorphism

Ex: Overloading , method overloading, constructor overloading, operator overloading.


2. Dynamic/Runtime polymorphism
Ex:  Method Overriding
Ex: Super class reference variable holding sub-class object is also known as Runtime polymorphism

Encapsulation:
Binding data and data members into a single unit/cell is known as encapsulation.
its nothing but hiding data or logics in single unit.
Ex: Object hiding data , Method hiding logics , Class hiding code

Abstraction:

Highlighting set of services to the users and hiding implementation code is known as Abstraction.

Abstraction can be implemented by using Interfaces and Abstract class/ Implementation class


Inteface:
For User/Client : Interface is set of services which user may use.

For Developers: Interface is set of services which we implements.

BankApplication:

Interface:
   withdraw();
    deposit();


InterfaceVar  i = new ImpClassObj();
