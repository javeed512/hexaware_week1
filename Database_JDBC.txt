Database:
Database stores data permanently in tabular format. 
Table will have rows and columns.

DBMS: Database software , which is use to manage data.

Databases: MYSQL DB , Oracle DB, H2 DB, Postgres DB , SqlServer DB

MYSQL:
-----


CRUD Operation:

C - Create (inserting record/data) : INSERT
R - Retrieve (fetching data)    : SELECT
U - Update (modifying data)     : UPDATE
D - Delete (delete/remove data)  : DELETE

Data types: integer , decimal ,double, bigint , boolean , date , char , varchar

1. create new database.
-> CREATE DATABASE DB_NAME;
-> use DB_NAME;


use vodafone;

CREATE TABLE Employee(eid integer(3) , ename varchar(20) , salary double);

INSERT INTO Employee values(101,'king',50000);

UPDATE Employee set ename ='king khan' , salary = 99000 where eid = 101;

SELECT * FROM Employee ;
SELECT * FROM Employee where salary > 30000;

SELECT * FROM Employee where eid = 101;

DELETE FROM Employee where eid = 101;

JDBC :
========
Java Data Base Connectivity.

java.sql.*;  (jdbc api)

Interfaces:
-----------
Driver 
Connection
Statement
PreparedStatement
ResultSet

Classes:
--------
DriverManager
Date



JDBC Steps:(download and add jar file only once)
-----------
1. Register Driver class with DriverManager
	 DriverManager.registerDriver(driver  class obj); or
          Class.forName(driver class name);
2. Get the connection
3. Create Statement 
	i. Statement : it is used for static query
	ii. PreparedStatement: it is used for dynamic query
4. Write sql query and 

5.execute by calling methods
	SELECT Query : any select query  --> executeQuery();  return   ResultSet
	Non-SELECT Query  : insert,update,delete (DML)   ---> executeUpdate(); return integer
6.close DB connection



CRUD OPERATIONS:
 
Logically  INSERT and UPDATE are same
Logically   DELETE ONE  and SELECT ONE are same

SELECT ALL is different




Design Patterns:
----------------
Design patterns are the solutions to the commonly, repeated occuring problems in programming or softwares.

Factory Design Pattern
Singleton Design Pattern
Prototype Design Pattern
