Primitive: byte,short,int,long  0 
		float 0.0f ,double  0.0
		boolean - false
		char - single space 

Non-Primitive / Reference Type:  String,Object,System,Employee,Customer, Any class/interfac
		default value - null.


In Java 3 types of variables:

1. Local variables
2. Instance variables
3. Static variables

Note: Above 3 types of variables can be declare using primitive datatypes(int,float,long,doubl,boolean) or by using reference types also(Object,String,Employee,Customer,Wrapper classes, any class type)


Local Variables:
----------------
Variable declare inside any java blocks or declare as parameters known as local variables.
Example of blocks methods,construtors,if,for,while,switch case,try-catch-finally ...
Note: Local variables values should be initialize by user , it cannot be initialize by JVM.



Instance Variables:
Variables declar inside the class without static keyword is known as instance variables or
 Object level variables
Note: Instance variable default values can be initialize by jvm.
Instance variables can be access by using this keyword or by using that class object.
Every object will have its own copy of instance variables. if we modify value in one object , will not effect other object values.


Static variables:
Variable declare inside the class with static keyword is known as static variables .
 They also known as Class Level variables.
Jvm initialize default values to the static variables.

In Java for every object same copy of static variables will be assign  unlike instance variables.
If you modify static value of one object it will effect all object values.

Static members can be accessible by using object ref or by using class name.
